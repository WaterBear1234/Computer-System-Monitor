# Computer-System-Monitor
A program that keeps track of CPU and memory utilization in percentages. Percentages are stored as a CSV file and recorded every 6 seconds, with 1 second for CPU measurement interval and 5 seconds for sleep delay. The CSV logging file will then be used to construct a graph that compares CPU and memory utilization over a certain time span.
